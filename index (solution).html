    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.

    // Question 1: img

    // Question 2: The attributes are height, width, class, src, alt, srcset, 
    // data-atf and data-frt.
    // Height and width dictates the height and width of the image, src is the url that the image comes from,
    // alt text helps screen reader show a description for the image, srcset tells the images to use in different browser situations
    // It gives the browser an option of images to choose based on screen size. 
    // data-atf and data-frt are custom data attributes, which stores data to the private application.

    // Question 3: 
    // The search input is a form element

    // Question 4: 
    // The third child of the search form element is a style tag, most likely for the form itself.

    // Question 5:
    // window.WIZ_global_data.GWsdKe value will say "en-US" meaning the browser window is set to US English
